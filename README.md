## Gentle Introduction

The [Vaguely Rude Place Names Map](https://www.vaguelyrudeplacesmap.com/) is a simple-ish web mash up of places which, to the British sense of humour, sound vaguely rude and thus are, by definition, funny. If you're not British, it might be confusing why this is amusing.

Meanwhile, here's some blog posts which may, or may not, explain how the map came into being.

## Credits

Thanks and credit is due to the following people and organisations:

* [Mark Iliffe](https://twitter.com/markiliffe) for saying to me once that "*you should make a map out of that*"

* [Bryan McBride](https://twitter.com/brymcbride) for making [Bootleaf](https://github.com/bmcbride/bootleaf), which is the foundation on which I built the second version of the map.

## Building

Either [fork](https://github.com/vicchi/vaguely-rude-places) or [clone](git@github.com:vicchi/vaguely-rude-places.git) the master GitHub repository.

Install the map's dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the source.

```bash
$ grunt build
```

See also the Grunt `dist` target which builds a distributable tarball.

There's a rudimentary Ansible playbook in `deploy` which is currently targeted at
the map's site at [`www.vaguelyrudeplacesmap.com`](https://www.vaguelyrudeplacesmap.com).
You'll want to edit the `inventory` file to point to your own server if you want to deploy this.
